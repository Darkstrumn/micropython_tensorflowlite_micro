# micropython_tensorflowlite_micro
[Tensorflow Lite Micro](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview) is a port of the Tensorflow Lite toolchain to extremely limtied memory and compute devices like microcontrollers.

[Micropython](https://micropython.org/) is a low footprint(RAM and ROM) port of Python to many microcontrollers.

Goals
------------
* Reduce barrier to entry for running Tensorflow Lite Micro toolchain on embedded platforms
* Enable coexistence and reuse of various micropython libraries with TF
