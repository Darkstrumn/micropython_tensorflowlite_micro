# micropython_tensorflowlite_micro
[Tensorflow Lite Micro](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview) is a port of the Tensorflow Lite toolchain to extremely limtied memory and compute devices like microcontrollers.

[Micropython](https://micropython.org/) is a low footprint(RAM and ROM) port of Python to many microcontrollers.

Goals
------------
* Reduce barrier to entry for running Tensorflow Lite Micro toolchain on embedded platforms
  * Eliminate the need to download SDK's, setup processor specific toolchains and debuggers as well as OS specific environments
  * Fast prototyping at the expense of some memory and speed
  * Enable ML practitioners (who are typically well versed in Python) to work with microcontrollers
* Enable coexistence and reuse of various micropython libraries with TF
